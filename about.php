            <h5>What is an online voting system?</h5>
            <p>
                An online voting system is a software platform that allows 
                groups to securely conduct votes and elections.High-quality online 
                voting systems balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting event.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                At their core, online voting systems protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters 
                from being able to vote multiple times. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to gather 
                in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any other means (e.g. email, insecure survey software).
                <br><br>
                You may hear an online voting system is referred to as an online election system, an online 
                e-voting system, or electronic voting. These all make reference to the same thing: a secure voting 
                tool that allows your group to collect input from your group and closely scrutinize the results in real-time.

            <h5>Benefits</h5>
            <p>
                Electronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of 
                paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. 
                Also in the long term, expenses are expected to decrease.[6] Results can be reported and published faster. 
                Voters save time and cost by being able to vote independently from their location. This may increase overall voter turnout. 
                The citizen groups benefiting most from electronic elections are the ones living abroad, citizens living in rural areas far 
                away from polling stations and the disabled with mobility impairments.
